# üöÄ Quick Resume Guide

**Last Session:** 2025-10-05 05:00 UTC
**Next Action:** Investigate service unresponsiveness during long operations

---

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

1. **Discovered the pipeline WORKS!**
   - Background tasks execute successfully
   - Job state manager captures all progress
   - Agents run sequentially as designed

2. **Rolled back to stable revision**
   - Active: `capi-demo-00037-vwh`
   - URL: https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app

3. **Identified the real issue**
   - Service becomes unresponsive during execution
   - Application logs not in Cloud Logging (stored in job state only)
   - Jobs DO complete, but can't query status while running

---

## üéØ First 5 Minutes After Resuming

```bash
# 1. Check if service is responsive
curl -s https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/ | head -5

# 2. Check previous job status (might have completed overnight)
curl -s https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/api/provision/status/b57802b8-d59a-4a4a-a4d5-f97ff4e59a98 | jq '.status, .current_phase, .overall_progress'

# 3. View all jobs
curl -s https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/api/provision/history | jq '.jobs[] | {job_id, status, customer_url}'

# 4. Check BigQuery for any completed datasets
bq ls --project_id=bq-demos-469816 | grep -E "solarwinds|_capi_demo_"
```

## üîß Main Issue to Fix

**Problem:** Service becomes unresponsive (HTTP 000) after starting long-running provision jobs

**Suspects:**
1. Memory exhaustion during LLM API calls
2. Event loop blocking (synchronous operations)
3. Cloud Run container crash
4. Too many concurrent operations

**Next Investigation Steps:**
1. Add memory monitoring
2. Check if LLM calls need `run_in_executor`
3. Test with smaller/faster operations first
4. Consider splitting into multiple Cloud Run services

## üß™ Recommended Test Sequence

### Option 1: Quick Health Check (5 min)
```bash
# Test with a fast-failing URL to verify pipeline starts
curl -X POST https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/api/provision/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_url": "https://invalid-test-url-12345.com"}'

# Should fail quickly at Research Agent
# This confirms background tasks work
```

### Option 2: Full E2E Test (3-5 min execution)
```bash
# Start real provision job
JOB_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/api/provision/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_url": "https://www.solarwinds.com"}')

JOB_ID=$(echo $JOB_RESPONSE | jq -r '.job_id')
echo "Job ID: $JOB_ID"

# Monitor progress (this is where service becomes unresponsive)
watch -n 5 "curl -s https://capi-demo-cuxcxfhcya-uc.a.run.app/api/provision/status/$JOB_ID | jq '.status, .overall_progress, .agents[] | select(.status==\"running\" or .status==\"completed\") | {name, status}'"
```

## üí° Quick Wins to Try

### Fix #1: Increase Memory
```bash
gcloud run services update capi-demo \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --memory=4Gi
```

### Fix #2: Add CPU
```bash
gcloud run services update capi-demo \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --cpu=2
```

### Fix #3: Increase Timeout
```bash
gcloud run services update capi-demo \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --timeout=900
```

---

## üêõ If Service is Completely Broken

```bash
# Rollback to revision 00037 (currently active)
gcloud run services update-traffic capi-demo \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --to-revisions=capi-demo-00037-vwh=100

# Or try a different working revision
gcloud run revisions list --service=capi-demo --region=us-central1
```

---

## üìû Key Discovery

**The orchestrator IS working!** Evidence from job `0e1810fd-34aa-4118-b0d1-f2508f0768bb`:
- ‚úÖ Pipeline started
- ‚úÖ Research Agent executed
- ‚úÖ Failed gracefully with SSL error (expected for test.com)
- ‚úÖ All logs captured in job state

**The problem is NOT that agents don't start - they DO!**
**The problem is that the service becomes unresponsive during execution.**

---

## üéØ Goal for Next Session

**Primary:** Fix service unresponsiveness so we can monitor progress in real-time

**Secondary:** Complete full E2E test with solarwinds.com through all 7 agents

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Service responds to health checks while job runs
- [ ] Can query job status during execution
- [ ] All 7 agents complete successfully
- [ ] Dataset appears in BigQuery
- [ ] Chat interface works with provisioned data
