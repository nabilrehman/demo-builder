        Current pain points:
        - Marketing team relies on static dashboards requiring SQL expertise
        - Data analysts spend 60% of time writing queries for business users
        - No self-service analytics for non-technical stakeholders

        Desired capabilities:
        1. Customer cohort behavior analysis (RFM segmentation)
        2. Product affinity and cross-sell opportunities
        3. Marketing attribution across 5+ channels
        4. Seasonal trend forecasting

        Key stakeholders:
        - CMO: Needs strategic insights without technical dependency
        - Marketing Analysts: Need to answer ad-hoc questions quickly
        - Finance Team: Needs revenue forecasting and cohort analysis

        Success criteria:
        - Enable non-technical users to ask complex analytical questions
        - Reduce time-to-insight from days to minutes
        - Demonstrate SQL-level complexity with natural language
