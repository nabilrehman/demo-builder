# ✅ Data Variety Enhancement - Applied Changes

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Problem Solved:** Insufficient data variety for visualization dashboards (e.g., SolarWinds only had 1 product, 1 customer)
**Approach:** Enhanced LLM Prompts with Statistical Distribution Guidance

---

## 🎯 Changes Applied

### File Modified: `backend/agentic_service/agents/synthetic_data_generator_markdown.py`

### Change 1: Increased Row Generation Limit ✅

**Lines:** 555, 700

**Before:**
```python
**Number of Records to Generate:** {min(row_count, 50)} realistic sample records
```

**After:**
```python
**Number of Records to Generate:** {min(row_count, 200)} realistic sample records
```

**Impact:**
- Products tables: 50 → 200 rows (4x increase)
- Customers tables: 50 → 200 rows (4x increase)
- All tables: Up to 200 rows per batch

---

### Change 2: Added Dashboard Visualization Context ✅

**Location:** After line 548 (new section before "YOUR TASK")

**Added:**
```markdown
## 📊 CRITICAL: DASHBOARD VISUALIZATION CONTEXT

**This data is for VISUALIZATION DASHBOARDS and BUSINESS ANALYTICS.**

Your data will be displayed in charts, graphs, and dashboards. It must have:

1. **HIGH VARIETY**: Generate DISTINCT entities - no duplicate names/titles/items
   - Every row should be UNIQUE
   - Create diverse examples across different segments
   - Aim for 80-150 truly distinct entities in this batch

2. **REALISTIC DISTRIBUTIONS** (for dashboard visualization):
   - **Power Law Pattern**: 10-15% premium/very popular, 25-30% above-average, 40-45% average, 20-25% budget/niche
   - **Geographic Variety**: If location-based, include 8-12 different regions/cities
   - **Category Spread**: If categories exist, spread across 5-8 distinct categories
   - **Value Range**: Include budget ($), mid-tier ($$), and premium ($$$) options
   - **Time Patterns**: Vary dates realistically across weeks/months (not all on same day)

3. **BUSINESS STORYTELLING**:
   - Data should reveal interesting patterns when charted
   - Create natural clusters and trends that make sense for the business
   - Include some outliers for visual interest (but keep realistic)
   - Make data "demo-worthy" - should show surprising insights when analyzed
```

**Impact:**
- LLM now understands this is for dashboards (not just data generation)
- Explicitly requests 80-150 distinct entities
- Guides LLM to create power law distributions
- Ensures data will look good in charts/graphs

---

### Change 3: Enhanced Variety Requirements ✅

**Location:** Section 5 (lines 648-696 - expanded from 4 lines to 48 lines)

**Before:**
```python
5. **VARIETY & DISTRIBUTION:**
   - Include diverse but realistic values across all fields
   - Follow realistic statistical distributions
   - Include edge cases but keep them realistic
   - Vary values to create interesting analytics patterns
```

**After:**
```python
5. **VARIETY & DISTRIBUTION FOR DASHBOARDS:**

   **CRITICAL - DISTINCT ENTITIES:**
   - Generate AT LEAST 100-150 TRULY DISTINCT entities
   - NO DUPLICATES: Every name/title must be completely different
   - NO SIMILAR VARIATIONS: Don't generate "Product A", "Product B"

   **REALISTIC PATTERNS FOR VISUALIZATION:**
   - Follow power law distribution
   - Geographic diversity: 10-15 different cities/regions
   - Category diversity: 5-8 distinct categories
   - Time diversity: Spread across weeks/months
   - Value diversity: Full range from low to high

   **FOR VISUALIZATION QUALITY:**
   - Bar charts should have varied heights
   - Pie charts should have meaningful segments
   - Time series should show realistic trends
   - Scatter plots should show natural clustering

   **SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BY TABLE TYPE:**

   📦 **Products/Items Tables:**
   - Budget tier ($10-50), Mid-tier ($50-200), Premium ($200-500), Luxury ($500-2000+)
   - Spread across 6-8 product categories
   - 15% bestsellers, 30% popular, 40% average, 15% niche
   - At least 50-80 distinct product names

   👥 **Customers/Users Tables:**
   - Company sizes: 15% Enterprise, 30% Mid-market, 40% SMB, 15% Startups
   - 6-8 different industries
   - 12-20 different cities from varied regions
   - At least 50-100 distinct customer names

   🛒 **Orders/Transactions Tables:**
   - Pareto distribution (20% of orders = 80% of revenue)
   - Value ranges: 30% small, 40% medium, 20% large, 10% very large
   - Frequency patterns: 10% weekly, 30% monthly, 40% quarterly, 20% rarely
   - Spread across last 6-12 months with growth trend

   📅 **Events/Activities/Sessions Tables:**
   - Time clustering during business hours (9am-6pm), weekdays > weekends
   - Power law user activity (10% users = 60% events)
   - Realistic event type distribution (70% normal, 20% important, 8% high, 2% critical)
   - Temporal spread across days/weeks
```

**Impact:**
- Provides specific numerical guidance (100-150 distinct entities)
- Table-type-specific requirements (products, customers, transactions, events)
- Statistical distribution patterns (Pareto, power law)
- Prevents duplicate/similar names
- Ensures dashboard-worthy variety

**SolarWinds Demo:**
```
Products Table:
- 50 rows total
- ~10-15 distinct product names
- Many duplicates or similar names
- Limited price variety
- Poor dashboard visualization
```

**Example Data:**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Row Count Strategy

The system still uses the same volume strategy:
```python
volume_strategy = {
    "dimension_small": 50,      # channels, categories
    "dimension_medium": 800,    # products, inventory
    "entity_medium": 3000,      # customers
    "entity_large": 3500,       # addresses
    "transaction_medium": 15000,# orders
    "transaction_large": 40000  # order_items
}
```

**Before:**
- System wants 800 products
- LLM generates min(800, 50) = 50 rows
- Result: 50 products (low variety)

**After:**
- System wants 800 products
- LLM generates min(800, 200) = 200 rows
- Result: 200 products (high variety)

**For tables with <200 target rows:**
- System wants 50 categories
- LLM generates min(50, 200) = 50 rows
- Result: No change (already generating all needed rows)

## ✅ Why This Works

### Comparison: Pure Faker vs Enhanced LLM

**Pure Faker Approach (from music example):**
- ✅ Great statistical distributions
- ✅ High volume (100K+ rows)
- ❌ Generic content ("John Smith Band")
- ❌ No business context
- ❌ Requires fixed schema

**Enhanced LLM Approach (our solution):**
- ✅ Domain-specific content ("SolarWinds NPM", "Nike Air Max")
- ✅ Business context (aligned with company research)
- ✅ Good statistical distributions (via prompt guidance)
- ✅ Works with dynamic schemas
- ✅ High variety (100-200 distinct entities)

**Key Insight:**
We're using LLM's strength (understanding context) while compensating for its weakness (limited variety) by:
1. Asking for more rows (200 instead of 50)
2. Providing explicit statistical distribution guidance
3. Emphasizing "DISTINCT entities - no duplicates"
4. Giving table-type-specific examples

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally ✅
```bash
# Restart backend to load changes
pkill -f "uvicorn api:app"
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && ./local_server.sh
```

### 2. Generate Test Demo
```bash
# Test with Nike or SolarWinds
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/provision/start \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customer_url": "https://www.nike.com"}'
```

### 3. Verify Data Quality
```sql
-- Check product variety
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) as distinct_products,
       COUNT(*) as total_rows
FROM `bq-demos-469816.nike_capi_demo_YYYYMMDD.products`;

-- Expected: 80-150 distinct products (was 10-15 before)

-- Check price distribution
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN price < 50 THEN 'Budget ($0-50)'
    WHEN price < 200 THEN 'Mid-tier ($50-200)'
    WHEN price < 500 THEN 'Premium ($200-500)'
    ELSE 'Luxury ($500+)'
  END as price_tier,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM `bq-demos-469816.nike_capi_demo_YYYYMMDD.products`
GROUP BY price_tier;

-- Expected: Distribution across all tiers (not 100% in one tier)
```

### 4. Deploy to CloudRun
- Changes will be included in next deployment
- Both validation fix + data variety enhancements together

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **LLM is essential** for domain-specific content (can't use pure Faker)
2. **Prompts matter** - detailed guidance produces better results
3. **Statistical thinking** can be encoded in prompts (don't need code)
4. **Row count matters** - 200 rows gives 4x more variety than 50
5. **Table-specific guidance** helps LLM understand context better

**The solution is simpler than hybrid Faker+LLM approach:**
- Same architecture
- Same code flow
- Just better prompts
- Higher row count
